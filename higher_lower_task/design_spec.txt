Outline
----
Write a program for a higher/lower guessing game. The computer randomly generates a sequence of up to 10 numbers between 1 and 13. The player, after seeing each number,
has to decide if the next number is higher or lower. If the player gets 10 guesses right, they win the game.

Example interaction
----
Starting number: 12
Higher(H) or Lower(L)? L
Next number 8
Higher(H) or Lower(L)? L
Next number 11
You lose

Requirements
----
- Ability to generate random numbers -> from random import randint -> randint(1,13).
- Ability to store previous randint (aka previous) and compare it to the next randint (numb).
- Ability to compare "previous" to "numb.

- User input - prompt for a standardised response, H or L. Convert to lower to handle mixed cases.
  - ideally catch any non "H" or "L" responses, but maybe just leave it up to user to not input the wrong commands.

- if else clauses to link the randint comparator to user input.
- Special handling to prevent current randint from equalling previous randint.
